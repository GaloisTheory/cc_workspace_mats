# Initialize Ralph in Current Project

Initialize Ralph Wiggum autonomous coding system in this project directory.

## Instructions

You are setting up Ralph for this project. Follow these steps:

### 1. Verify Git Repository

Check if we're in a git repository:
```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

If not a git repo, warn the user and ask if they want to initialize one.

### 2. Locate Ralph Templates

Find the Ralph workspace templates. Check in order:
1. `$RALPH_WORKSPACE/ralph/templates/` (if RALPH_WORKSPACE env var is set)
2. `../099_workspace_setup/ralph/templates/` (sibling workspace)
3. `../../099_workspace_setup/ralph/templates/` (parent's sibling)

If templates not found, inform the user and provide manual setup instructions.

### 3. Create Directory Structure

Create these directories if they don't exist:
- `specs/` - For specification files

### 4. Copy/Create Files

For each file, check if it exists first. **Never overwrite existing files** - warn and skip instead.

**AGENTS.md** (from template):
- Copy from `templates/AGENTS.md.template`
- Tell user to customize validation commands for their project

**IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** (create empty):
```markdown
# Implementation Plan

> Generated by Ralph. Do not edit manually during active sessions.

## Overview

[Plan not yet generated. Run `ralph plan` to generate from specs.]

## Tasks

[No tasks yet]
```

### 5. Update .gitignore (if needed)

Check `.gitignore` and add these entries if not present:
```
# Ralph working files (optional - some prefer to track these)
# IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
```

Note: Most Ralph files SHOULD be tracked in git. The plan is your state.

### 6. Print Summary

After setup, print:
- What was created vs skipped
- Next steps:
  1. Edit `AGENTS.md` with your project's validation commands
  2. Run `/ralph-specs` to generate specifications
  3. Run `ralph plan` (in separate terminal) to generate implementation plan
  4. Run `ralph build` (in separate terminal) to start building

### Important Notes

- Ralph prompts live in the workspace, not copied to each project
- `AGENTS.md` and `specs/` are project-specific and should be customized
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is generated and updated by Ralph

## Example Output

```
✅ Ralph initialized in /path/to/project

Created:
  - specs/
  - AGENTS.md (customize validation commands!)
  - IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

Skipped (already exist):
  - .gitignore

Next steps:
  1. Edit AGENTS.md with your project's test/lint commands
  2. Run /ralph-specs to define what to build
  3. Run 'ralph plan' in a separate terminal
```
